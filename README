About the potential:

This potential is the Stillinger-Weber with a modification of the 3-body term.
The constant epsilon is eliminated, and the cossine harmonic term is substituted by a piece-wise 3-order polynomial function over cossine of theta.
The coefficients and number of pieces are to be given by the user.
The space [-1,1] is discretized into N equal intervals. The i^th interval is then I_i=[x_{i-1},x_i], with i=1,...,N.
The functional form over interval I_i will be:

f_i(x) = a_i + b_i (x-x_i) + c_i (x-x_i)^2 + d_i (x-x_i)^3

How to use it:

Call of swpoly potential from input file is equivalent to sw.
For the current version, only one set of coefficients can be given, which can be used for different interactions.
But it is not currently possible to use different coefficients for different interactions.
The coefficients for the 3-body term must be inside a file called coeffs.swpoly, that should be in the work directory (same as input file).
This file have to contain the number of intervals in the first line, followed by the four coefficients for each interval (a_i, b_i, c_i and d_i) in every line.
